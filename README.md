# Log-Archive-Tool

This tool helps you archive logs by compressing them and storing them in a new directory. It keeps your system clean while saving logs in a compressed format for future use.

## Features
- Compresses logs into `.tar.gz` files.
- Archives logs in a new directory with a timestamped filename.
- Logs the date and time of each archive.

## Usage

Run the tool with the log directory as an argument:

```bash
./log-archive.sh <log-directory>
```
